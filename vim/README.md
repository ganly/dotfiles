vim files
=========

Adding these by unzipping rather than git submodules.

But here's a list of what has been installed:

[sensible.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)

[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

[vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown)

[vue.vim](https://github.com/posva/vim-vue.git)
