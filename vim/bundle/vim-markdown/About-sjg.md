About these files
=================

I obviously downloaded from somewhere, but I'm not sure where.

From the datestamps it looks like 7th April 2019


The git repo is at
https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown


I currently have a problem where all files I open have folding turned on.

I don't want this.

Apparently it's fixed as noted in
https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/pull/131

Which I found via 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5017009/confusion-about-vim-folding-how-to-disable


I updated the files by hand (13th June 2020) since I'm not yet using
git submodules. (sigh)
